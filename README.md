# [commit 4785de2] Initialized homepage and corresponding components

Initialized a dummy homepage with a website title and a directory containing all the tabs: about-us, all-fundraisers and facts-and-reports.

Note: I used sass for styling, so make sure to run the following command before yarn start. (sass is not necessary, css is totally fine for our project) 

run `yarn add node-sass@4.14.1`
